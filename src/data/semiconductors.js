Soitec trades at $6B with a justified monopoly premium on SOI wafers.

Ciena at 20x is cheaper on an absolute basis and benefits from the same optical bandwidth demand, but has a more cyclical telecom business that weighs on its multiple. The key question is whether Ciena's WaveLogic 6 DSP franchise will see comparable demand acceleration as DCI optical scaling continues, which would narrow the gap. Jensen's GTC 2026 statement that both copper and optics will scale together validates demand for both companies.",
